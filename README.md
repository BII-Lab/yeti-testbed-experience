# Experiences from Root Testbed in the Yeti DNS Project

   This document reports and discusses issues in DNS root services,
   based on experiences from the experiments in the Yeti DNS project.
   These issues include IPv6-only operation, the root DNS server naming
   scheme, DNSSEC KSK rollover, root server renumbering, multiple root
   zone signer, and so on.  This project was founded in May 2015 and has
   since built a live root DNS server system testbed with volunteer root
   server and resolver operations.
